Download, parse, and display Oklahoma Election results

Learning by doing. I'm muddling my way through learning Python. With this project I'm tying in a lot of things like the urllib, zip files, csv modules. So far it downloads a zip file from Oklahoma's State Election Board, extracts the csv inside, and displays certain columns from the csv. Eventually, it will be a commandline app that can be set to monitor particular races on a timed basis as results are updated on the Election Board website. Ideally, you should be able to view individual races, state-wide, or county as well as ballot questions.
